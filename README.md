## ðŸ’¢ Project Overview

This project is to analyze factors influencing psychological distress of medical students.

We use a dataset containing data on medical students' mental health in Switzerland: demographic information, self-reported health status, psychological tests results, and survey responses.  

## ðŸ’¢ Problem Statement

With the given dataset we try to answer the following questions: 

- is there any strong correlation between mental health factors?
- are there any different patterns in burnout, empathy and health depending on categorical variables?
- how language spoken by the medical students relates to mental health? 
- can we predict the occurence of psychological distress looking at demographic variables and psychological tests results?

## ðŸ’¢ Installation
Anaconda distribution of Python should be just fine to run the code here (Python versions 3.*).
